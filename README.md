# ksuauv_makerfaire_2017
These are the instructions on how to use this code similar to our demonstration at Makerfaire 2017.

Our project took the sensor data from an ultrasonic sensor and made it modify the output of a brushless motor.

To use this code:

Download the Arduino IDE Here: 

https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

Copy our code 'sketch_oct16a.ino' or current version onto your desktop.

Upload the Sketch to your arduino.

Verify our to-do list to make sure everything is plugged in correctly.

Turn it on and plug in the battery and it should be working.

If you have any questions please email ksu.auv@gmail.com and ask for Vinh/Alec. (2017-2018)
